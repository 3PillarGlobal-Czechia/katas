Your client is one of the oldest banks in a country and they are having problems with maintaining their old COBOL system.
You are hired to write a new banking application.

Step 1:
* Write a class *Account*
* Account has owner, interest, and balance
* Account implements methods to deposit, withdraw and add interest, toString

Step 2:
* Write a class *Bank* that will hold a list of accounts

Step 3:
* This bank is not very good at planning. So they somehow forgot to mention they will need multiple types of accounts. But surely, your solution is ready for that.
* Implement a class *OverdraftAccount*
* Account has overdraft limit, which will allow the owner to withdraw money even if there is a negative balance up to overdraft limit.


Recommendations:
- Focus on design
- Follow SOLID/CUPID principles
- Write unit tests
- Implement classes to separate class library
